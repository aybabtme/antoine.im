# The World Sucks Because You Use Dumb Units

We were promised flying cars. It's 2015 and we don't have them. I demand explanations and I've found at least one: we're still being stupid about our usage of units.

## Complexity, Reject Complexity

We can understand problems that fit in our mind. Everybody has limited brain capacity and can only connect so many dots. Because of that, the nature of most problem solving initiatives revolves around simplifying things until they fit in our brain. Creating abstractions, reducing complexity, opting for the simple approach as a mean to progress in our endeavour.

Some people understand that _reducing complexity_ is like, a really important thing that you should try to do all the time. Some fields are instinctively searching for that, for instance physicists or mathematicians who aren't satisfied with a theorem until a simple, elegant form has been found. I'm not sure if they deliberately search for simplicity and elegance for that purpose, or just because they have some spiritual belief that the Truth is simple, but the end result is that the science we produce and celebrate most tends to be the one that is most amenable to human comprehension (or I hope).

For instance, if we were robots with infinitely scalable computing resources, we would not care for some additional detours in reasoning. Because we would just be following a more complex path relentlessly and eventually reach our goal. But we're not robots so we have to cope with our limitations. Stuff is complex, gets more complex all the time and there's no other way to deal with progress than by reducing complexity _all the time_. It's the only way.

## You Can Comprehend This? I Can't Comprehend This

Sometimes I'm looking at numbers on all the things, like toothpaste tubes I'm planning on buying, or the rate of climbing of the plane I'm flying on, or some other random thing. And then I try to make sense of them. Try to understand how things correlate to one another. And I can't.

Here's a motivating example:

> "Oh, I know I can run 3m/s, and this Kerbal Space Program rocket orbits at 3000 m/s."

How do I know that I can run 3m/s? Because I know about how long a second is, and about how long a meter is. I can guess how fast I walk. I can relate to the difference in magnitude involved between _running_ and _orbiting_. To what it 'means'. To the scale of the problem: if I could run 3 orders of magnitude faster, I could orbit this planet. That's pretty cool, being able to relate to a concept like 'orbiting' in a way that relates to something like 'running' that you can experience everyday.  Orbiting is still a daring endeavour, but at least now I feel like it's something within reach.

But you can't do that most of the time. Nope. Because we're dumb. We still use all kinds of different units all over the place. Two toothpaste tubes, one is 0.05 $/gram, the other 1.50 $/ounce. Which one is cheapest? I don't know, am I supposed to pull a unit converter out of my pocket in the drug store for each product I'm looking at? Sure no. And everything is like that. I'm pretty interested in making informed decisions and I find it's hard to do. And I deal with logic, numbers and measurements everyday as part of my work. I can only imagine just how non-plussed someone who's not into numbers in the first place must be at the whole ordeal. I bet that somewhere in their childhood, they faced the artificial complexity of mashed-up units and unconsciously decided that this was too complex a problem to care about. Not worth wasting brain space on that.

We measure and give numbers about a bunch of things, but it's all useless. A burger is 500 calories? What's that again, in kilojoules? How many kilojoules per day again, 2000?  Or was that in calories? Want to live healthy, good luck. Unless you dedicate a large part of your brain to keeping track of energy unit conversion tables, you can't. Here's a random guess: America has obesity issues because of the imperial system. No way people can make sense of their food when all the numbers have little relations.

## Imperial Units Kill Imagination

You might be wondering: "just how good is my body at producing and using energy". Or maybe you don't wonder about that just now, but pretend you do. Say you want to compare the efficiency of your body to, I don't know, a Tesla Model S. Why not! I eat 2000 calories a day and I can walk at least 20 km a day pulling 100 kg of mass (myself + backpack): that's about the furthest I can recall walking. A Model S can do 500 km with 85 kWh, pulling 2239 kg of mass. How can I relate to that?  What the hell is a kilowatt*hour. It's an energy quantity. 85 kWh translates directly to calories, or to joules, they're the same damn thing. But I can't make sense of it because we use dumb units to talk about things.

For the sake of the argument, 2000 calories is ~8e3 joules and 85 kWh is ~3e8 joules. I can walk 1000 m with 4 joules/kg. A Tesla Model S can drive 1000 m with ~270 joules/kg. Think about that, how bodies are pretty awesome. And think about what it means for the future: we're nowhere near the limit of what science can produce. We could have 33,500 km range electric cars if we could achieve the same efficiency as a human body. The circumference of Earth at the equator is about 40,000 km, so you could drive 3/4 of the planet on a single charge. Obviously those are very approximate numbers with super leaky abstractions, but the idea is: now that I comprehend the magnitude of the difference, I can see where we stand on the scale of progress.

## We Can't See Basic Truths Because We're Dumb About Units

I posit this: the average person would make much better decisions if we used consistent and simple units all over the place. The average person would be less scared away from numbers if the numbers were all making sense between one another. The average person would be way more interested in science, because they could more easily understand how things relate together and have Eureka moments discovering facts. The average person would be more motivated to do more, to do better, if they were able to relate and make sense of numbers more easily.

If we all agreed to use a consistent and simple unit system, the average good-decision-making of the world would rise up. More people would see opportunities, more problems would be solved. There's so many facts that are laying out there in plain sight, but we're purposefully hiding them away when we chose to use units that are not relatable.

## Your Argument Is Super Hyperbolic

It sounds like it is. But think about it, how big the compounding effect of a small thing which permeates *all the thing* can have over time. You're harmful to humanity when you talk of square feet, of miles per hours, of ounces and yards and knots.

Just use SI units. There's 7 base units, use them.

* Length: meters.
* Mass: kilograms.
* Time: seconds.
* Electric current: amperes.
* Temperature: kelvin.
* Amount: mole.
* Luminous intensity: candela.

## Benchmarketing Harmful To Humanity

Also another pet peeve of mine. When you talk about _rate per time_ please use seconds. For speed: use m/s. Why not km/h? Because after 1s, the base of time changes to some crazy construction of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, 52 weeks in a year, and what not.

It's all crazy.

Just base all your _rate per time_ units off seconds. You serve 1 billion requests per months? Just use seconds. Stop messing up with scales just to inflate your ego. 1e9 req/month is 385 req/s, it's not even that much. Stop lying to yourself and use SI units.
